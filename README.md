# Kotaku Digest
Concise way to view Kotaku articles!

---

## How It Works
This app scrapes articles directly from Kotaku (www.kotaku.com) using Cheerio (NPM). After doing this, it stores the articles via Mongoose into a MongoDB database. You can view these articles rendered on the main page after scraping.
